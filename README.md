My [Canary repo](https://github.com/anb94/Canary) contains a singularity based tool that was published in BMC Bioinformatics. Canary is a tool which allows for the semi-automated conversion of MaCH files to PLINK files for GWAS analysis. 

The [Mallard repo](https://github.com/anb94/mallard) is a machine learning disease-related gene prediction tool being developed by myself, @VangieY, and @benlee2405. It is an attempt to build upon our groups previously published model with LUAD.

I am currently working on improvements to [RNA-Seq tutorial](https://github.com/anb94/bioc-rnaseq-workflow) for students to follow on their lab PC.
