My [Canary repo](https://github.com/anb94/Canary) contains a singularity based tool that was published in BMC Bioinformatics. Canary is a tool which allows for the semi-automated conversion of MaCH files to PLINK files for GWAS analysis. 

I am currently working on improvements to a basic [RNA-Seq tutorial](https://github.com/anb94/bioc-rnaseq-workflow) for new students to follow on the lab server with minimal set up.
