## Hi there 👋

I am Bioinformatics Postdoc at City Univeristy of Hong Kong. \
I’m currently working on computational drug repositioning for non-communicable diseases.

The repo 'Canary' contains a singularity container and tool for semi-automated file conversion in GWAS analysis and was published in BMC Bioinformatics.
